# Game Review for Lego Stunt Rally

## Details

### Game Title
Lego Stunt Rally

### Rating
6/10

## Summary
So on a very basic level, Lego Stunt Rally is purely a game for racing, but in a very wacky looking way.  Also it the controls work sorta like a slot car in that you can't control things like turning, but you can switch lanes, accelerate, and brake.  Of course, it's a lego game so you can expect mamy lego themed environments to be within the game.

The main feature of the game is that you're able to create your own tracks.  However this is limited when you first start the game until you finish the career mode, as well as a number of races.  Doing so unlocks more and more options for customization of the tracks.  Things like environments, track pieces, and powerups become available the more you play.

The story mode for this game is quite boring if I'm being honest, even for a lego game.  It's a pretty linear story where you're a hero trying to win this race competetition held by some wacko billionaire.  It's a lot of repetitive racing that honestly a two year old child could win in, which I guess is fair since it's still a lego game.

The one thing that I can say I like about this game is the cast of characters.  There's a decent amount of characters with varying and unique personalities to at least enjoy their interactions.  It's also cool that each one got their own customized vehicle to suit their themes.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, it's not a horrible game, but not a great one either.  It's fun for a young child who likes moving cars and legos, but anyone else will find themselves bored out of their minds.  The main problem of course is the lack of control when racing your car, which takes a lot of the fun out of what makes a racing game fun to play.
