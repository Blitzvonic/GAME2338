                                                 Bungie Testing Halo 3
The first step that we see Bungie take during their day is testing the basic fundemental parts of the game, such as loading it up,
making sure the weapons work, and then making sure you can exit the game properly.  This is a great first step for the day because
it allows them the chance to make sure everything is working as it should, and that nothing major has changed from the previous
testing day.

A big part of Bungie's testing of the game was manual testing, where they basically had two sets of eyes watching the screen
at the same time, one person playing and another purely watching.  A great idea in my opinion, cause it allows for double the 
chance for something wrong to be noticed, and allows for a different view point of what's going on on-screen.

Another part of this manual testing is them going around the maps and just doing completely ridiculous things in a attempt to make
sure each map works as it should.  They go to some places and just jump repeatedly to see if the game breaks.  They run around and
hit walls to make sure there's no holes in the map that players can get through to leave the gameplay area.  They attempt to climb
rocks and trees in any manner they can think of.  All of this to just to ensure that people can't break the game somehow.  Now 
while this is definitely one of the most tedious processes, it's highly important to make sure players can't abuse aspects of the 
map that could make it unbalanced.  Of course though, the gaming community is crazy and will always find a way, despite the hours
of testing these guys do.

Next up on Bungie's chore list is online multiplayer.  They have to test that every single time they make a change in singleplayer 
to make sure that nothing got messed up.  They have to check to make sure that there's no game breaking bugs, glitches, etc.  After
that they do international online testing with their Japanese team to make sure network connections are functioning correctly.
This phase of testing is highly important, especially for a franchise like Halo that has a massive online community, so putting the
game through its paces in multiplayer is the best way to make sure it all functions correctly.

The next step is a three year usability testing period where they have a group of players playing the game constantly.  There are 
also psycology researches that take part of this testing to see how the game affects the players mentally.  This part is quite
interesting in my opinion cause it does factor in the mental toll the game could take on a player, especially in high stress
missions and such.

The biggest step that comes up next is play testing.  Here a group of out of house players come in and just play the game for a
period of time while the developers watch.  Here they're on the lookout for where players get stuck, or get frusturated, in the 
campaign.  There are people who play on the multiple difficulties to see the reactions to thos difficulties.
They see how gameplay works in multiplayer, especially where players tend to die the most.  Afterwards they compile everything
they find and do their best to fix what didn't work, and make sure the fun factor is as high as possible.  This of course is 
one of the most important phases of testing simply because it's this group that they are trying to appeal to.  Here they can see
what they could improve upon with honest reactions to their work.
