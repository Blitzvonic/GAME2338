## Details

### Game Title

### Rating
On a scale of 1-10, I place this game at an 8!

## Summary
Overatch is an online multiplayer arena style type of game, where there are two teams of six, and your goal is to either capture or defend
a certain point on the map.  There are three types of modes, each with their own play style to them.  Two Capture Point games are where
there are two points that an attacking team must capture in order to win the round, while the defending team must prevent the capture
of those points.  There's Escort, which is where an attacking team must escort a payload across multiple points on a map, with a 
defending team once again doing their best to prevent this from happening.  Finally, there is King of the Hill. where there's a single 
point on the map that one of the two teams must take control of, and defend, for as long as possible or up to 100% capture.
  
There is also a nice little arcade area within the game where more casual players can enjoy a variety of special game modes.  Here 
you'll find wonky rule sets such as allowing the choice of more than one character per team, messed up gravity settings, super
charged abilities, and much more.  There is also a game creator library mode, where players can create their own game types within 
Overwatch, or choose from a list of currently ongoing games.  There have been some crazy things made out there so far, such as Agar.io 
modes, snipers only with only headshots, Pacman, and a plethora of other modes.

Within the game there is a very large and unique cast of characters that you are able to choose from when you play.  This cast is 
split into three types, damage, tank, and support.  Damage is, of course, where the DPS characters are whose kits are more focused
on dealing out the most amount of damage possible.  Tanks are the much higher HP characters whose abilities are more centralized
in defending their teammates from oncoming damage from the enemy team.  Finally, the support characters are the ones whose ability
sets are more focused on healing or buffing up the other members of team, keeping the team alive as long as possible.  Currently.
there is a total of thirty one different characters the player can choose from, with even more to come later on as new characters are
released every two or three months.
## Final Thoughts
Overall, Overatch is quite the fun game to play, especially when you have friends that you can play it with.  The only main problem
is that the community within the game can be pretty toxic with their behavior sometimes, especially within the lowers ranks of 
competetive play.  Changes have been made to reduce the level of toxicity, which is overall appreciated.  In the end though, I do
believe this game is overwhelmingly fun and I invite others to play it too!
