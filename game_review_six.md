## Summary
 Sea of Thieves is a pc and xbox exlusive open world rpg. You play as pirates roaming the seas for fortune and adventure to become a true pirate lord.  You are
 able to play with up to four people per pirate crew, with the ship you get being dependent on that.
 
 Gameplay wise, the game is very simple.  You're a pirate, you have a sword and some guns, and you have a ship to pilot.  Ships range
 from sloops to galleons, all depending on the size of the crew you're playing with.  The most complex gameplay is in controlling your
 ship, where it takes mulitple functions and factors to make it move, such as adjusting the sails, and controlling the helm.
 
 The main thing you get to do in the game is take quests to earn gold and cosmetics.  Quests range from simple search and destroy, gather
 quests, etc.  You can also raid forts to face down skeleton strongholds to capture even more worthwile loot.  You fight wave after waves
 of skeleton zombies and if you survive you get high tier loot that's worth plenty of money, on top of the reward for surviving the fort.
 
 The main stay for the game, in my opinion, is that it is still an open world game.  The player is free to do as they please, however they
 please.  You can attack other players that are on the server with you. You can fight the kraken or megalodoms or skeleton pirate ships. Or
 you can do what I do, and just get your friends and go around singing sea shanties for hours on end to entertain the other players in the
 server.

## Final Thoughts
The game itself is pretty fun as it's sorta like Minecraft to where it's dependent on the player to make fun for himself.  Now, the lack of
actual set gameplay is a turn off for some people, I personally find myself enjoying the freedom to do what I want.  There's nothing
wrong with making a game where the player crafts their enjoyment, instead of the game doing it for them.
