**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer: The game itself is very story driven so the rules were obvious.  Everything about playing the game is laid out
            for the player and explained well, so there is no confusion whatsoever.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer: Everything in the game that can be seen or done was essential to the gameplay experience, and thus there was nothing to be 
            removed.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:  The game is very balanced and easy as, again, it is very story driven so there isn't much to be unbalanced.  There are some 
            puzzles and such that can take a bit of time to figure out, but otherwise it's all very fair.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:  The timing of the game is very purposeful and done well.  There are slow parts for the emotional moments, faster areas
            between dialogue and gameplay, etc.  Everything feels good and I didn't find myself bored at any point.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer: The mechanics of the game worked really well for setting the pace and theme of the game.  You're a couple of doctors running
            around in a person's memory, and the way you play the game very much reflects that.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:  This game did not leave me with a single moment where I wasn't enjoying what I was playing.  The story is extremely well 
             crafted and emotional, and I found myself intensly invested in what I was playing.  I could play this game over and over
             again if I could, just to experience it again.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer: The game itself is very well done and there were absolutely no problems that had popped up during gameplay.  Zero issues to
            to be found.  There were no errors, glitches, or bugs of any sort.
