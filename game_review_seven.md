### Rating
10/10
## Summary
GTA V is a sort of free roam, racing esque, fps game where you go around commiting crimes, robbing stores, and a bunch of other things
to gain money.  With the money you buy cars, planes, cool buildings, and more, until you become just the ultimate crime lord.  A 
huge attraction of the game though, is the amount of freedom that is given to the players in its mini gamemode creator for online.

GTA V has what I think is possibly the most free form level editor of any video game out there.  There is just an endless amount of
possibilities that can be done within it.  You can create massive racing tracks, huge stunt ramps, battle arenas, and much more.
There's the possiblity of making fun shooter modes like team deathmatch, zombies, one in the chamber, etc.  Racing modes where you
have to defend a vehicle from slowing down too much, being a blocker while smaller cars are running to different objectives, and
sumo wrestling with cars.  GTA V's game editor just allows you to do whatever that might come to mind, however you want.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, GTA V is quite honestly the perfect game to play if you want full freedom to make whatever game mode you want.
