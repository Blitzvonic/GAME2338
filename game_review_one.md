### Rating
On a scale of 1-10, I place this game at a solid 8!

## Summary
Realm of the Mad God is an mmorpg where players create a character based on certain classes, like knight, archer, wizard, etc.  Each character class has unique sets and stats that separate them from the rest of the classes, be it different abilities, or higher/lower specific stats.  When the player plays Realm, you go out, fight monsters, collect loot, and gear up your character.  The player also can find stat potions, such as defense or attack potions, which permanently raise a stat by one value.  Over time, the player will have collected high rarity gear, as well as maxed out the stats of their character.  It’s a lot of time and work that goes into this process.
	However, Realm is in fact a permadeath game.  If the player ever has the misfortune of dying with their character, that character is essentially deleted from the game.  Any gear held by the character, as well as all of their stat points, are completely lost on death.  The character is wiped from the game entirely, with absolutely no chance of reclaiming anything that is lost.  It is that which truly embodies what it means to be a permadeath game in my own opinion.
	It is because of this extremely harsh punishment that people flock to this game.  It appears that the fear of such a terrible cost on death appeals to the more hardcore of gamers out there.  There is more intensity to this sort of mmorpg where you have to play carefully, as well as have an in depth knowledge of all of the game’s mechanics, as well as how mobs and bosses in the game work, so the player may prolong the life of their characters.  As time goes on, the player also gains fame which, on death, tallies up to a “final score” of sorts that can lead to the player being put in the hall of fame that consists of other dead characters with similarly high fame.
  The overall "goal" of the game is really to just keep your character alive as long as possible, collect as much loot as you can, and kill as many boss monsters as you can.  There really is no "set goal", as it's really all about just doing the same thing over and over again.  You can, however, say that the end goal is to end up high on the hall of fame for characters once you die.

## Final Thoughts
I like the fact that this game is permadeath, as it adds an element of fear to dying, unlike most RPGs out there.  However, I will say that I hate that it takes real life money to be able to create more characters, instead of having an ingame way to do it.
