**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer: The game is very easy to pick up as it's a brawling/shooter fighting game where all you have to do is kill the other
            players in the game.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer: Everything within the game can stay in it as all items serve a purpose to making the game fun.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer: It is pretty balanced in that all players are exactly the same, so no one holds and advantage over the other.  Weapon
spawns are all random so there's no way to gain a massive advantage unless you're lucky.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer: The game is very fast paced, which is good because it's the type of game you can play for hours on end and never get
bored of what you're doing.  Games start, and end, quite quickly and are never prolonged.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer: The mechanics did work to the overall theme as it's a stick character fighting game, and the wonky movements of the 
player characters match what'd you expect from a stick character.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer: This game is an absolute blast to play for hours on end with your friends.  Every round is never the same, and it's 
fast paced so you can just keep going and going.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer: One big problem is that online play with random people can be a bit buggy/laggy.  Makes the game hard to play, or makes
things unfair as these laggy players kill you and it's hard to even hit them.  This is mostly an issue with the servers of the games,
and can be avoided by just playing with friends or having a LAN party.
