# Game Review for Monopoly Streets

## Details

### Game Title
Monopoly Streets

### Rating
6/10 it is in fact a Monopoly game.

## Summary
So this game is essentially plays like normal Monopoly, but in video game form.  You roll dice to move, you collect properties
as you go along the board, and try to get the most amount of money possible while bankrupting the other players.  It's just a nicer
looking version of the original board game.

Some cool things about this game though is that it allows for a much more streamlined way to play the game.  The annoying things
like moving your piece, counting money, auctioning properties, etc. is all done automatically so less there's hassle for the 
players.  The UI of the game itself is simple and easy to understand, making it easy to see how much money and properties you have,
where on the board you are, where others players are, and a map of the board where you can see what you can buy.

The animations within the game are also pretty neat.  Spaces are brought to life with pop ups on the properties that you buy,
creating more life within the game.  Each property also tends to match what a property in that kind of income zone would look like,
so the cheaper properties are more run down while the more expensive ones are in much better shape.
## Final Thoughts
Overall I think that I prefer to play this version of Monopoly over the analog board game version, simply for the sake of removing
a lot of the hassle that comes with the physical version of the game.  While you can't have as many players as the original game,
four people is enough to create a intense enough game.
