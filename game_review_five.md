## Summary
So YGOPro is literally just a free online version of the famous card game, Yu-Gi-Oh!.  In it you have a system that allows the 
player to build whatever deck they so choose, and play against either an AI or other people across the globe.  The system
is fully automated so that anything the player does goes into effect immediately, without having to worry about reading the
cards themselves.

The automatic system of YGOPro is definitely the main attraction to the game.  It fully automates every move the player makes, 
so that those who are playing don't have to go through the hassle of reading card effects fully, and keeping the overall pace
of the game much faster than if you were to play the game with actual cards.  Monster effects are put into action, and anything
that a player can do in response happens when it needs to be.  Say a monster attacks and you have a trap card set on the field, 
the system will tell you that "hey, this trap card can do something, wanna use it?", which is great for making sure that you don't
miss an oppurtunity to win.

A big thing about YGOPro is the allowance of the player to utilize any card in the game that they want, with absolutely zero
money needed to do so.  Everything is free and open to everyone, which means everyone has equal oppurtunity to play the game
without having to worry about whether or not you have a certain card.  Unlike the real life equivalent of the game, where cards
are extremely limited either in how many are printed, or how much a card can cost, some reaching in the hundreds of dollars.

Another cool feature is that you can freely customize the UI of the game, as well as the card images.  You can have custom 
backgrounds, custom card backings, and even custom images of the card art.  It really allows for a player to make themselves 
comfortable with the game.  It also helps with people who want to stream or record themselves playing the game, since they can
just customize things to avoud copyright infringement.

## Final Thoughts
All in all, YGOPro is absolutely the game to play if you want to play Yu-Gi-Oh! without any form of restraint.  A full automatic 
system to where everything is done for you lends credit to why you would want to play this version of Yu-Gi-Oh! over the 
analog version of the game.  It keeps things enjoyable, and fast paced, without all of the slow draggin slog that comes
with playing Yu-Gi-Oh! in real life.
